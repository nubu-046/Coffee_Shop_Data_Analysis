# Coffee_Shop_Data_Analysis
## Project Objective
This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of a coffee shop's transaction data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI. The goal was to clean, transform, and explore the dataset to gain meaningful insights about sales, orders, and profit trends.

## Dataset used

## Project Highlights
-Cleaned raw transaction data using pandas: handled missing values, inconsistent entries, and outliers.
-Engineered new features such as:
  -Profit = 12% of Total Spent
  -Categorized customers by Age Group
  -Created a visual summary using Power BI Dashboard including:
  -Sales by Item
  -Monthly Trends (Orders, Revenue)
  -Profit Breakdown
  -Filter options by Item, Order Type, Payment Method, and Month
